## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

  - Rachel:
    - Flexibility
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Anvay: backend and express
  - Rachel: backend and express
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - rewatching lectures
  - code reviews 
### Conflict Resolution
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - n/a; we both think we're at the same skill level, so it'll be likely that both of us contribute equally
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - n/a; we both think we're at the same skill level, so it'll be likely that both of us contribute equally
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - help each other understand content that either of us is weaker in
  - work on the same content together so we can find the best way to solve an issue
